# scrollspy-example
ScrollSpy is one of the somewhat more complex examples of what Bootstrap can
do. I wanted to try to pare some of the examples I saw down to *just about*
the bare rudiments for pedagogic purposes because they often contain extra
stuff that tends to obfuscate the basic functioning of this part of Bootstrap.
